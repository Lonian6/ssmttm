This is the recording of a jazz reggae concert. There is a saxophone lead playing a solo. There is a keyboard and an electric guitar playing the main tune with the backing of a bass guitar. In the rhythmic background, there is an acoustic reggae drum beat. The atmosphere is groovy and chill. This piece could be playing in the background at a beach. It could also be included in the soundtrack of a summer/vacation/tropical themed movie.
這是一場爵士雷鬼音樂會的錄音。薩克斯風主奏獨奏，鍵盤和電吉他演奏主旋律，貝斯伴奏。在富有節奏感的背景音樂中，是雷鬼原聲鼓點。氣氛輕鬆愜意，令人放鬆。這首曲子非常適合在海灘邊播放，也適合作為夏季/度假/熱帶主題電影的配樂。
